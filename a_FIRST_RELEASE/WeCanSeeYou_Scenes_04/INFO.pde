 USE
 This sketch detects faces & takes snaps with the webcam. 
 Images are saved in a folder on a local server (Dropbox).
 Basic idea for this sketch is to imagine some sort of 
 machine/human interaction when the computer 'sees' you. 
 
 This sketch uses a system of 'Animation scenes' which keeps everything together.
 Students can add their own sketches as a class and these then make up a scene
 which can be called individually as the program runs.
